# WG API Sharp library #

## Description ##
**[WG API Sharp]** is a library which should help people using .Net/C# to interact with WarGaming [API](https://developers.wargaming.net/).  

## Project status ##

<font color='orange'><b>Beta launched</b></font>

For the moment I have released a beta version. I have covered most of the API exposed methods. I feel that future changes should not shake the entities too much.

## 3<sup>rd</sup> party ##
The tools used to develop the library:
  * Visual Studio 2017
  * [Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json)

## Disclaimer ##
I am in no way affiliated with [WarGaming] company. I have only created a wrapper for the original [API](https://developers.wargaming.net/).
